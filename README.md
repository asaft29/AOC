# ðŸ¦€ Advent of Code in Rust ðŸ¦€

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) â€” a series of daily programming puzzles released every December.

I'm using this challenge to improve my Rust skills, as Iâ€™m planning to write my **Bachelorâ€™s Thesis** using Rust.  
Specifically, I want to build an **anonymous network** (similar to Tor), and I believe Rust â€” being a modern, compiled systems language â€” is perfect for the job.

## Setup and Folder Structure

I create a separate folder for each day to make it easier for anyone interested to follow along.  
If youâ€™re unsure how to test the solution for a specific day, donâ€™t worry â€” hereâ€™s a simple example:

### 1. Install Rust

If you donâ€™t have Rust installed yet, download it here: [Rust installation page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Follow the instructions to install Rust and Cargo (the Rust package manager).

### 2. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asaft29/adventofcode.git

cd adventofcode

cd 2024

# Run the solution for the desired day
cargo run --bin day_xx

```

### 3. Double check the input files!

**Advent of code** has a different pool of puzzle inputs, so make sure you change my inputs with yours if they do not match.
